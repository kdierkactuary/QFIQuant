Suppose you are given the following information:

* Assume no-arbitrage 
* It is currently time 0
* A policyholder has an initial investment of 200,000 and receives direct participation rate p~dp~ on their investment
* The continuous (flat) interest rate is r = 2% 
* The time horizon is T = 1 year
* S~t~ denotes the stock price at time t
* One unit of at-the-money European option A has a payoff of $max[ \frac{S_1}{S_0}-1,0]$
* One unit of option A costs $0.04 for purchase today 

If the insurer replicates the guarantee by purchasing a zero-coupon bond and call options, and assuming no-arbitrage, determine the dollar position they should invest in:  

(a) Zero coupon bonds 
$$ 200,000e^{-.02*1} = 196,039.74$$

(b) Risk budget spent on options
$$ 200,000 - 196,039.74 = 3,960.26$$

(c) Determine p~dp~
$$ V_0*p_{dp}=1-e^{-.02}$$
$$ .04 * p_{dp} = 1-e^{-.02}$$
$$p_{dp} = \frac{1-e^{-.02}}{.04}=49.5 \%$$
