# Problem 1

Consider the following process X~t~ for $t \in [0, 1]$. X~0~ = X~1~ = 0.
For 0 < t < 1, X~t~ is defined as:

$$ X_t = (1-t)   \int_{0}^{t} \frac{1}{1-u} \,dW_u $$

Note: For parts (a) and (b), find the SDE over 0 < t < 1 for the process X~t~ defined for $0 \le t \le 1$.

(a) Determine the stochastic differential equation dX~t~. Is X~t~ a martingale?

$$ X_t = (1-t)   \int_{0}^{t} \frac{1}{1-u} \,dW_u $$
$$ \frac{X_t}{1-t} = \int_{0}^{t} \frac{1}{1-u} \,dW_u $$
$$ d(\frac{X_t}{1-t}) = d(\int_{0}^{t} \frac{1}{1-u} \,dW_u) $$
By quotient rule: 

$$ \frac{(1-t) dX_t - (-1)dtX_t}{(1-t)^2} = \frac{1}{1-t}dW_t $$
$$ (1-t) dX_t + X_t dt = (1-t) dW_t$$
$$ (1-t)dX_t = -X_t dt + (1-t) dW_t $$
$$ dX_t = -\frac{X_t}{(1-t)}dt+dW_t$$

X~t~ is not a martingale because dX~t~ has a drift component. 

(b) Determine the stochastic differential equation dF~t~ where $F_t = X_t^2$. Is F~t~ a martingale?

Use Ito's Lemma:

$$ \frac{\partial F_t}{\partial t} = 0 $$
$$ \frac{\partial F_t}{\partial X_t} = 2X_t $$
$$ \frac{\partial^2 F_t}{\partial X_t^2} = 2$$

$$ dF_t = 0 dt+2X_tdX_t+\frac{1}{2}2(dX_t)^2$$
$$ dF_t = 2X_t(-\frac{X_t}{(1-t)}dt+dW_t)+dt$$
$$ dF_t = (-\frac{2X_t^2}{(1-t)}dt+2X_tdW_t)+dt$$
$$ dF_t = (1-\frac{2X_t^2}{(1-t)})dt+2X_tdW_t$$

F_t is not a martingale because dF~t~ has a drift term.
