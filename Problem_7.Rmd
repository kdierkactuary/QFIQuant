The market risk actuary for an insurance company is looking at different short rate models to use to model interest rates for pricing variable annuity guarantees. The model that has traditionally been used is the Vasicek model with dynamics given by:  
$$dr_t = \gamma(\overline{r} - r_t)dt + \sigma dX_t$$
The market risk actuary calibrates the model to zero-coupon bond prices observed in the market to determine that $\gamma=0.2$, $\overline{r}=0.04$, and $\sigma=0.05$. Assume the current value of the instantaneous short-rate is $r_0=0.03$.  

(a) Determine the risk-neutral probability that the instantaneous short rate will be negative in 4 years. 

$$E[r_t]=r_0e^{-\gamma t} + \overline{r}(1-e^{- \gamma t})$$
$$= .03 e^{-.2(4)} + .04 (1 - e^{-.2(4)})$$
$$=.035507$$

$$Var[r_t] = \frac{\sigma ^ 2}{2 \gamma}(1 - e^{-2 \gamma t})$$
$$= \frac{.05^2}{2(.2)}(1-e^{-2(.2)(4)})$$
$$= .004988$$

$$P[r_4 < 0] = P[\frac{r_4 - \mu}{\sigma} < \frac{0 - \mu}{\sigma}]$$
$$= P[Z < \frac{0 - .035507}{\sqrt{.004988}}]$$
$$= \Phi(-0.50274)$$
$$= .30757$$

(b) Describe the strengths and weaknesses of using the Vasicek model for modeling interest rates.  
* Strengths:
    + **Mean Reverting**- the model is mean reverting which matches the empirical behavior for interest rates. 
    + **Simple** - the model is simple and easy to understand. 
    + **Analytically Tractable** - the model is analytically tractable and has closed form formulas for zero-coupon bond prices and certain interest rate derivatives. 
* Weaknesses:
    + **Single Factor Model** - the Vasicek model is a single factor model. So it is only able to model parallel movements in the yield curve and is unable to match more complex dynamics of the yield curve. 
    + **Unable to reproduce market term structure** - The standard Vasicek model is unable to reproduce the market term structure of zero-coupon bonds. 
    + **Negative Interest Rates** - the Vasicek model allows for negative interest rates. Which is incompatible with the empirical evidence. 
  
(c) The market risk actuary would like a one factor interest rate model that does not allow for negative interest rates.  Describe two alternative models the market risk actuary could use. 
  Two alternative one factor interest rate models that do not allow for negative interest rates are:
* **Cox-Ingersoll-Ross** - An extension of the Vasicek model that eliminates the possibility of negative interest rates.
    + $dr_t=\gamma(\overline{r} - r_t)dt + \sigma \sqrt{r_t}dX_t$
* **Black-Karasinski** - A log-normal interest rate model. 
    + $y_t = ln(r_t)$
    + $dy_t = (\theta_t - \gamma_t y_t)dt + \sigma_tdX_t$
